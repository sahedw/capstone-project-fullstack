 * @name InfoBox
 * @version 1.1.13 [March 19, 2014]
 * @author Gary Little (inspired by proof-of-concept code from Pamela Fox of Google)
 * @copyright Copyright 2010 Gary Little [gary at luxcentral.com]
 * @fileoverview InfoBox extends the Google Maps JavaScript API V3 <tt>OverlayView</tt> class.
 *  <p>
 *  An InfoBox behaves like a <tt>google.maps.InfoWindow</tt>, but it supports several
 *  additional properties for advanced styling. An InfoBox can also be used as a map label.
 *  <p>
 *  An InfoBox also fires the same events as a <tt>google.maps.InfoWindow</tt>.
